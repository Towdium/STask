abstract = {Scheduling computation tasks on processors is the key issue for high-performance computing. Although a large number of scheduling heuristics have been presented in the literature, most of them target only homogeneous resources. The existing algorithms for heterogeneous domains are not generally efficient because of their high complexity and/or the quality of the results. We present two low-complexity efficient heuristics, the Heterogeneous Earliest-Finish-Time (HEFT) algorithm and the Critical-Path-on-a-Processor (CPOP) algorithm for scheduling directed acyclic weighted task graphs (DAGs) on a bounded number of heterogeneous processors. We compared the performances of these algorithms against three previously proposed heuristics. The comparison study showed that our algorithms outperform previous approaches in terms of performance (schedule length ratio and speedup) and cost (time-complexity)},

@article{Virzi1992,
abstract = {Attention has been given to making user interface design and testing less costly so that it might be more easily incorporated into the product development life cycle. Three experiments are reported in this paper that relate the proportion of usability problems identified in an evaluation to the number of subjects participating in that study. The basic findings are that (a) 80{\%} of the usability problems are detected with four or five subjects, (b) additional subjects are less and less likely to reveal new information, and (c) the most severe usability problems are likely to have been detected in the first few subjects. Ramifications for the practice of human factors are discussed as they relate to the type of usability test cycle employed and the goals of the usability test.},
